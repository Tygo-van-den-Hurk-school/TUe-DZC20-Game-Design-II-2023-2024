# Game-Design-II
Games offer us small windows into alternate realities and subsequently can be 
powerful learning and transformational experiences. The course Learning and 
Persuasion in Games delves into the more psychological aspects and mechanics 
of games, to determine why they work and how you can use this to create highly
engaging playful tools for persuasive and/or educational purposes.

So you think you know how to make a nice game. Think again! Games are complex
interactions between the player and the virtual world. As a game designer you
try to balance player autonomy with your artistic goals in interesting fantasy
stories where the player experiences mediated presence.

This course examines the ways in which game design decisions affect our 
emotions, our cognition, our motivation, and subsequently help shape our 
attitude. And above all, how you can use this knowledge in order to create 
compelling experiences that teaches the user valuable real world lessons and
changes the way they perceive the world. All through the power of play!

## Game
In this game, the player, a posible arciteture student, will have to design 
buildings. These buildings are premade by use, but are made with a flaw, and
then it is their job to fix our intentional mistake. 

### Pop-ups
In the game, if your structure is unstable, or for other reasons not well made,
then the player will receive a pop-up saying whats wrong, and how to hopefully
fix it.

some examples of these pop-ups are:
<ul>
	<li>
		<pre>
			<code>
				Structural integretie low
				It appears that the structure is unstable. You can fix this 
				by reinforcing the part that crashed. Try enforing the area 
				and try again. Click "OK" to continue.
			</code>
		</pre>
	</li>
	<li>
		<pre>
			<code>
				Out of Balance
				It appears that the structure is unstable. You can fix this by
				reinforcing the part where the structure is moving. Try 
				enforing the area and try again. Click "OK" to continue.
			</code>
		</pre>
	</li>
	<li>
		<pre>
			<code>
				bending Materials
				It appears that the structure is unstable. You can fix this by
				reinforcing the area where material is bending beyond a 
				reasonable messure. Try enforing the area and try again. Click
				"OK" to continue.
			</code>
		</pre>
	</li>
	<li>
		<pre>
			<code>
				Foundation Issues
				It appears that the structure is unstable. You can fix this by
				reinforcing the foundation where there are signs of instability.
				Strengthening the base should help stabilize the entire
				structure. Click "OK" to proceed. 
			</code>
		</pre>
	</li>
</ul>
