# Game-Design-II
Games offer us small windows into alternate realities and subsequently can be powerful learning and transformational experiences. The course Learning and Persuasion in Games delves into the more psychological aspects and mechanics of games, to determine why they work and how you can use this to create highly engaging playful tools for persuasive and/or educational purposes.

So you think you know how to make a nice game. Think again! Games are complex interactions between the player and the virtual world. As a game designer you try to balance player autonomy with your artistic goals in interesting fantasy stories where the player experiences mediated presence.

This course examines the ways in which game design decisions affect our emotions, our cognition, our motivation, and subsequently help shape our attitude. And above all, how you can use this knowledge in order to create compelling experiences that teaches the user valuable real world lessons and changes the way they perceive the world. All through the power of play!
